Title: What's For Dinner? 

Live URL: https://reciperestaurantfinder--seshamachiraju.repl.co/

Summary: 
My app is based around our innate love of Pinterest recipes. 
Because most of us are only humans, these recipes never end the way we want them to.
So I have proposed an alternative: 'What's For Dinner' lets you enter whatever cuisine 
you're feeling like (i.e Indian, Chinese, etc.) & then your location (i.e. Seattle)
and then gives you recipes of that cuisine type AND if the recipe fails
you have a fallback option of going to one of the restaurants close by!
